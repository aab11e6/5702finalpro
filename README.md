This project is a final project for EDAV.

It is based on a insurance claims dataset which is retrieved from https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/992mh7dk9y/2.

The primary objective of this study is to dissect and analyze the intricate relationships between various factors that lead to insurance fraud. By delving into aspects such as geographical trends, policy features, demographic characteristics of the insured, the nature of the incidents, and vehicle-related information, the study aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these elements interplay and contribute to fraudulent activities in the insurance sector.

Furthermore, the insights gained from this study have the potential to inform the development of more sophisticated policy structures and underwriting processes. This can lead to more balanced and fair pricing of insurance premiums, ensuring that honest policyholders are not unduly burdened by the costs associated with fraudulent activities.
